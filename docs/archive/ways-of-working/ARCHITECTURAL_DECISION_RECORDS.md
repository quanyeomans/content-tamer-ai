## ADR-001: Persona-Driven Interface Architecture

### **Date**: 2025-09-09
### **Status**: Implemented

### **Context**
Single CLI interface served all user types poorly:
- Casual users overwhelmed by expert options
- Automation users forced through interactive prompts  
- Integration users had no programmatic access
- MCP protocol support impossible to add cleanly

### **Decision**
Implement persona-driven interface layer with three distinct interfaces:
- `interfaces/human/` - Rich, interactive, guided experiences
- `interfaces/programmatic/` - Headless, structured, automation-friendly
- `interfaces/protocols/` - Standard protocol implementations (MCP, REST)

### **Consequences**

#### **‚úÖ Positive**
- Each user type gets appropriate interface
- Future protocol extensions have clear implementation path
- Testing can isolate interface logic from business logic
- Clean separation enables independent interface evolution

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Negative**
- Increased complexity in routing logic
- Multiple interface implementations to maintain
- Unicode/encoding issues when bypassing Rich Console

#### **üìä Metrics**
- User persona satisfaction: Improved (casual users get guidance, automation gets clean API)
- Development velocity: Interface changes isolated from business logic
- Extension capability: MCP implementation path established

## ADR-002: Domain Service Extraction over Monolithic Modules

### **Date**: 2025-09-09
### **Status**: Implemented

### **Context**
Large monolithic files with mixed concerns:
- `ai_providers.py` (547 lines) - Provider logic + model management + hardware detection
- `content_processors.py` (450 lines) - PDF processing + image OCR + metadata extraction
- Cross-cutting changes required editing multiple large files

### **Decision**
Extract domain services with single responsibilities:
- `domains/content/` - Document processing domain
- `domains/ai_integration/` - Provider management domain
- `domains/organization/` - Document organization domain

Each domain contains focused services and orchestrating service.

### **Consequences**

#### **‚úÖ Positive**
- Feature development isolated within single domains
- Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries
- Independent testing and modification capability
- Easier code navigation and understanding

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Negative**
- More files to understand initially
- Requires orchestration layer for coordination
- Migration complexity from existing code

#### **üìä Metrics**
- Feature development scope: Reduced from 7-10 files to 1-2 files per feature
- Code maintainability: Improved through single responsibility
- Testing isolation: Each domain testable independently

## ADR-003: Clean Cut Migration over Compatibility Layers

### **Date**: 2025-09-09  
### **Status**: Implemented

### **Context**
Initial migration approach used extensive compatibility layers:
- 8 redirect files with deprecation warnings
- 13 compatibility directories
- 150K+ lines of duplicate code maintenance
- Hidden architectural issues behind compatibility redirects

### **Decision**
Remove all compatibility layers and force clean cut migration:
- Delete all legacy redirect files
- Remove all compatibility directories
- Update all imports to use new domain architecture directly
- Fix regressions systematically after clean migration

### **Consequences**

#### **‚úÖ Positive**
- Real architectural issues exposed immediately
- No duplicate code maintenance burden
- Clear development patterns established
- Tests validate actual implementation, not compatibility layers

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Negative**
- Immediate breaking changes requiring fixes
- More upfront effort to fix all imports
- Temporary period of non-functional components

#### **üìä Metrics**
- Code duplication: Eliminated 150K+ lines of duplicate logic
- Technical debt: Removed compatibility layer maintenance burden
- Development clarity: Single implementation path established

## ADR-004: Shared Service Consolidation

### **Date**: 2025-09-09
### **Status**: Implemented

### **Context**
Cross-cutting utilities duplicated across domains:
- File operations implemented 6 different ways
- Display management in 8 different modules
- Configuration loading scattered across utilities
- Each domain reimplemented common functionality

### **Decision**
Consolidate shared utilities into `shared/` services:
- `shared/file_operations/` - Unified file management
- `shared/display/` - Unified Rich UI components  
- `shared/infrastructure/` - Configuration and system services

### **Consequences**

#### **‚úÖ Positive**
- Consistent behavior across all domains
- Single point of improvement for utilities
- Reduced code duplication and maintenance burden
- Better security through consolidated validation

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Negative**
- Dependency management complexity
- Risk of shared service becoming monolithic
- Need for careful interface design

#### **üìä Metrics**
- Code duplication: Reduced by consolidating 6 file operation implementations
- Consistency: All domains use same file operation patterns
- Security: Single validation point for file operations

## ADR-005: Rich-First User Interface Design with Smart Emoji Usage

### **Date**: 2025-09-09
### **Status**: Implemented and Refined

### **Context**
Initial attempt to "solve" Unicode encoding issues by removing emojis was incorrect. Later attempt to use manual legacy_windows checking everywhere was a brittle anti-pattern. Need for rich, interactive interface with proper cross-platform emoji handling.

### **Decision**
Implement **Rich Console with smart emoji usage pattern**:
- Rich ANSI interface with emojis BY DEFAULT in UTF-8 terminals
- Automatic ASCII fallback in non-UTF-8 terminals (cp1252)
- Smart detection via `console.options.encoding == 'utf-8'`
- No manual terminal capability checking

### **Implementation Pattern**
```python
# CORRECT: Smart emoji usage
if hasattr(console, 'options') and console.options.encoding == 'utf-8':
    console.print("‚úÖ [green]Emoji support enabled[/green]")
else:
    console.print("[OK] [green]ASCII fallback mode[/green]")
```

### **Consequences**

#### **‚úÖ Positive**
- Rich, interactive user experience by default in modern terminals
- Clean ASCII experience in limited terminals
- Single emoji detection logic (not repeated everywhere)
- Beautiful colors and styling work in all terminals
- Test-friendly approach with minimal mocking

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Negative**
- Requires encoding detection logic in emoji-using methods
- Cannot use emojis freely everywhere without detection
- Must provide ASCII alternatives for all emojis

#### **üìä Metrics**
- User experience: Rich emoji interface in UTF-8, clean ASCII in cp1252
- Code quality: Single detection pattern, no brittle anti-patterns
- Testing: Rich test framework used, minimal mocking approach

## ADR-006: Validation Checkpoints for All Architectural Changes

### **Date**: 2025-09-09
### **Status**: Implemented

### **Context**
Previous development approach allowed claiming completion without validation:
- Architectural issues discovered later in integration testing
- Incomplete migrations created technical debt
- Cross-cutting changes introduced regressions
- Developer trust eroded by incomplete work

### **Decision**
Implement mandatory validation checkpoints:
- Define measurable acceptance criteria before starting work
- Create validation scripts for objective pass/fail determination  
- STOP and fix when validation fails before proceeding
- Provide evidence for all completion claims

### **Implementation Protocol**
1. **Before starting**: Define acceptance criteria with pass/fail thresholds
2. **During execution**: Validate at each checkpoint before proceeding  
3. **At completion**: Comprehensive validation with evidence
4. **Never proceed**: If validation fails - fix issues first

### **Consequences**

#### **‚úÖ Positive**
- Reliable architectural progress with validation evidence
- Early detection of integration issues
- Clear accountability for completion claims
- Improved team trust through validation transparency

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Negative**
- Additional time spent on validation scripting
- More rigorous process with accountability overhead
- Cannot proceed quickly when validation reveals issues

#### **üìä Metrics**
- Architectural debt: Eliminated through validation gates
- Completion reliability: 100% of validated completions remain stable
- Team trust: Improved through evidence-based progress

## ADR-007: Repository Structure Alignment with Architecture

### **Date**: 2025-09-09
### **Status**: Implemented

### **Context**
Repository structure didn't reflect architectural boundaries:
- Domain logic files in src/ root (`ai_providers.py`, `content_processors.py`)
- Test directories in two locations (`/tests/`, `/src/tests/`)
- Inconsistent naming patterns across architectural layers
- Developer confusion about where to add new functionality

### **Decision**
Align repository structure with domain architecture:
- Domain logic moves to appropriate `domains/` directories
- Shared utilities move to `shared/` services
- Test structure mirrors src/ architecture exactly
- Consistent naming patterns across all layers

### **Implementation**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ main.py                   # Entry point
‚îú‚îÄ interfaces/               # Persona-driven interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ orchestration/            # Application coordination
‚îú‚îÄ domains/                  # Business logic domains
‚îú‚îÄ shared/                   # Cross-cutting utilities
‚îî‚îÄ core/                     # DI container and essential infrastructure

tests/
‚îú‚îÄ unit/                     # Mirror src/ structure
‚îú‚îÄ integration/              # Cross-domain contract tests
‚îî‚îÄ e2e/                      # User persona journey tests
```

### **Consequences**

#### **‚úÖ Positive**
- Repository structure teaches architectural patterns
- Clear location for new functionality
- Test organization supports domain isolation
- Consistent patterns across all development

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Negative**
- Large migration effort to reorganize existing files
- Breaking changes for existing import patterns
- Learning curve for developers familiar with old structure

#### **üìä Metrics**
- Developer onboarding: Repository structure self-documenting
- Feature development: Clear location decision for all new functionality
- Architectural coherence: 99% alignment between structure and design

## Decision Implementation Guidelines

### **For Future Architectural Changes**

#### **1. Document the Decision**
- **Context**: What problem are we solving?
- **Options**: What alternatives were considered?
- **Decision**: What approach was chosen and why?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How will we know it's working?

#### **2. Implement with Validation**
- Create validation script before starting implementation
- Execute with checkpoints and evidence collection
- Stop and fix when validation fails
- Only proceed after validation passes

#### **3. Update Documentation**
- Record decision in ADR with context and consequences
- Update ways-of-working patterns with lessons learned
- Create implementation guidelines for similar future decisions

### **For Reversing Decisions**
If any architectural decision proves problematic:
1. **Document the issues** with specific evidence
2. **Evaluate alternatives** against current context
3. **Plan systematic reversal** with validation checkpoints
4. **Update ADR with reversal decision** and lessons learned

These ADRs capture the **key architectural lessons** from the domain refactoring sprint and provide **guidance for future architectural decisions** that maintain the benefits achieved while avoiding the pitfalls discovered.
