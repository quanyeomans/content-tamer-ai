# Development Standards

## Code Quality Standards

### Python Code Style
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: All Python code must follow PEP 8 standards
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: All functions and classes must have descriptive docstrings
- **Import Organization**: Follow isort standards for import organization

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% test coverage for core functionality  
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for all functions, integration tests for workflows
- **BDD Testing**: Use Gherkin scenarios for user-facing features
- **Test Naming**: Descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: System should handle errors without crashing
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Error messages should be actionable and clear
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Retry Logic**: Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Security Standards

### Data Handling
- **No API Key Logging**: Never log or store API keys in plain text
- **File Validation**: Validate all input files for security threats
- **Content Sanitization**: Sanitize extracted content before AI processing
- **Local Processing**: Keep file processing local, only send content to AI

### Code Security  
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security scans of all dependencies
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs and file paths
- **Secure Defaults**: All configurations should use secure defaults
- **Permission Minimization**: Request minimum required file permissions

## Architecture Principles

### Modularity
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module should have one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Use dependency injection for testability
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces over large monolithic ones
- **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between modules

### Performance
- **Async Operations**: Use async/await for I/O bound operations where beneficial
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage, avoid memory leaks
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache expensive operations appropriately
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of resources and connections

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Feature Branches**: All new features developed in dedicated branches
- **Descriptive Names**: Branch names should clearly describe the feature/fix
- **Small Commits**: Atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages
- **PR Reviews**: All changes must be reviewed before merging to main

### Commit Standards
- **Conventional Commits**: Use conventional commit format for messages
- **Atomic Changes**: Each commit should represent a single logical change  
- **Testing**: All commits should pass the full test suite
- **Documentation**: Update documentation with code changes

## Release Management

### Version Control
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semver for all releases
- **Changelog**: Maintain detailed changelog for all releases  
- **Release Notes**: Clear release notes highlighting changes and breaking changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Deployment
- **Automated Testing**: All releases must pass automated test suite
- **Staging Environment**: Test releases in staging before production
- **Rollback Plan**: Have rollback procedures for failed deployments
- **User Communication**: Communicate changes and impacts to users
