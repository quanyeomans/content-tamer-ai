# Security Standards

## Overview
Content Tamer AI processes potentially sensitive documents and must maintain the highest security standards to protect user data and system integrity.

## Data Protection

### User File Security
- **Local Processing**: All file processing occurs locally on user's machine
- **Content Only**: Only extracted text content sent to AI providers, never the actual files
- **No Storage**: No user content stored or cached on external systems
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest where applicable

### API Key Management
- **Environment Variables**: API keys stored as environment variables only
- **No Logging**: API keys never logged, printed, or stored in plain text
- **Memory Protection**: Clear API keys from memory after use where possible
- **Secure Input**: Use secure input methods for API key entry

### File System Security
- **Path Validation**: All file paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Permission Checks**: Verify file permissions before processing
- **Temporary Files**: Secure handling and cleanup of temporary files
- **Sandboxing**: Process files in isolated contexts where possible

## Input Validation

### File Validation
- **File Type Checking**: Validate file types against allowed extensions
- **Magic Number Verification**: Check file magic numbers, not just extensions
- **Size Limits**: Enforce reasonable file size limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Malware Scanning**: Basic checks for known malicious file patterns

### Content Sanitization  
- **Text Extraction**: Sanitize extracted text before AI processing
- **Encoding Validation**: Validate character encoding to prevent injection
- **Content Filtering**: Remove potentially dangerous content patterns
- **Length Limits**: Enforce reasonable content length limits

## Network Security

### AI Provider Communication
- **HTTPS Only**: All AI provider communication over encrypted HTTPS
- **Certificate Validation**: Verify SSL/TLS certificates
- **Timeout Handling**: Implement appropriate timeouts for network requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect AI provider rate limits to prevent blocking

### Error Handling
- **Information Disclosure**: Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- **Stack Traces**: Production errors don't expose internal system details  
- **Logging Security**: Logs don't contain sensitive data or credentials
- **Graceful Degradation**: System fails securely without exposing internals

## Access Control

### File System Access
- **Minimum Permissions**: Request only necessary file system permissions
- **User Consent**: Explicit user consent for file access operations
- **Path Restrictions**: Restrict file operations to user-specified directories
- **Cross-Platform Security**: Consistent security behavior across platforms

### Process Security
- **Privilege Dropping**: Run with minimum required privileges
- **Resource Limits**: Implement resource usage limits to prevent abuse
- **Clean Shutdown**: Secure cleanup on application termination
- **Signal Handling**: Proper handling of system signals and interrupts

## Dependency Management

### Third-Party Libraries
- **Security Scanning**: Regular security scans of all dependencies
- **Version Pinning**: Pin dependency versions for reproducible builds
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Use minimal set of dependencies to reduce attack surface
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated with security patches

### Supply Chain Security
- **Package Verification**: Verify package integrity and signatures where possible
- **Source Control**: All dependencies from trusted, well-maintained sources
- **License Compliance**: Ensure all dependencies have compatible licenses
- **Vulnerability Monitoring**: Monitor for disclosed vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling
- **Detection**: Monitoring and alerting for security-relevant events
- **Response Plan**: Documented incident response procedures
- **User Communication**: Plan for communicating security issues to users
- **Recovery Procedures**: Steps for system recovery after security incidents

### Vulnerability Disclosure
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Process for receiving and handling security reports
- **Timeline**: Reasonable timeline for addressing reported vulnerabilities  
- **Communication**: Clear communication about security fixes and updates
- **Credit**: Appropriate credit for security researchers who report issues

## Compliance Considerations

### Privacy Regulations
- **Data Minimization**: Process only the minimum data necessary
- **User Control**: Users maintain full control over their data
- **No Tracking**: No user behavior tracking or analytics collection
- **Consent Management**: Clear consent for any data processing operations

### Industry Standards
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Follow OWASP secure coding practices
- **Common Vulnerabilities**: Protection against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **Secure Development**: Integrate security into development lifecycle
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic security reviews and assessments

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Security Practices
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs at system boundaries
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent injection
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that doesn't leak information
- **Crypto Standards**: Use well-established cryptographic libraries and standards

### Testing Security
- **Security Testing**: Include security tests in test suite
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing of key functionality
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews for sensitive components
- **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to identify security issues
