# Ways of Working
*Guardrails for consistent, high-quality development*

## Purpose

These documents provide the structure and checkpoints to ensure I consistently follow our established practices instead of rushing to code solutions.

## Streamlined Workflow

### üõ°Ô∏è [PRE-CODE_CHECKLIST.md](./PRE-CODE_CHECKLIST.md)
**Essential gates before any implementation**
- 4 mandatory pre-implementation gates
- TodoWrite planning integration
- Security and backward compatibility review
- Red flags and pause points

### üß™ [IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md](./IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md)  
**Step-by-step TDD process with TodoWrite integration**
- Test-first implementation steps
- Security validation checkpoints
- Integration testing guidance
- Completion validation criteria

### üîß **DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW** *(Current Focus)*
**Centralized system dependency detection and configuration**
- Implement cross-platform dependency detection (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Create persistent configuration with JSON caching to prevent repeated searches
- Integrate CLI commands (`--check-dependencies`, `--refresh-dependencies`)
- Auto-configure external tools (Tesseract OCR, Ollama LLM)
- Extend timeout values for large operations (Local LLM model downloads)
- Consolidate test architecture following user feedback

## Usage Instructions

### For Every Code Change

1. **Start with PRE-CODE_CHECKLIST.md**
   - Complete all 4 mandatory gates
   - Use TodoWrite to plan and track tasks
   - Confirm test file and security approach

2. **Follow IMPLEMENTATION_WORKFLOW.md** 
   - Write failing test first
   - Implement minimal solution
   - Validate security and integration
   - Complete with proper cleanup

### For Dependency Management Implementation *(Current Priority)*

**When to Use**: Implementing centralized dependency detection and configuration

1. **Architecture Planning**: Create centralized DependencyManager class with cross-platform support
2. **TodoWrite Planning**: Break into phases (detection, caching, CLI integration, testing)
3. **Implementation**: Cross-platform common installation locations, persistent JSON configuration
4. **CLI Integration**: Add `--check-dependencies`, `--refresh-dependencies` commands
5. **Testing Consolidation**: Follow user feedback to consolidate tests in existing files
6. **Timeout Extensions**: Handle large operations (Local LLM downloads) with appropriate timeouts

**Recent Examples**: DependencyManager (32 tests), CLI integration (consolidated), Local LLM timeout fix (10-minute support)

**Current Architecture (2024)**: Modern dependency injection with ApplicationContainer pattern, centralized Rich UI management via ConsoleManager, and comprehensive Rich testing infrastructure via RichTestCase framework.

## Reference Documents

The following detailed guides provide additional context:

### üîí [SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md](./SECURITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
**Comprehensive security validation**
- API key security requirements
- File system security checks  
- Input validation patterns
- Common vulnerability prevention

### ‚úÖ [COMPLETION_CRITERIA.md](./COMPLETION_CRITERIA.md)
**Detailed definition of "done"**
- Technical completion requirements
- Functional validation steps
- Quality gate confirmation
- Documentation standards

### üîÑ [BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE.md](./BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY_GUIDE.md)
**When to preserve vs break existing behavior**
- Default preservation approach
- Breaking change decision framework
- Migration strategies
- Communication requirements

## Key Principles

### Test-Driven Development
- **Always write tests first** - No exceptions
- **Test user behavior** - Not implementation details  
- **ApplicationContainer Pattern** - Use TestApplicationContainer for dependency injection in tests
- **Rich UI Testing** - Inherit from RichTestCase for Rich UI component testing
- **Minimal mocking** - Only mock external services
- **Real file operations** - Use temp directories
- **Console isolation** - Use proper console management to prevent pytest I/O conflicts

### Security by Design
- **Never log API keys** - Environment variables only
- **Validate all inputs** - File paths, user data, content
- **Secure defaults** - Fail safely, restrict permissions
- **Safe error messages** - No information disclosure

### Quality Standards
- **Type hints required** - All new functions
- **Docstrings required** - Clear descriptions
- **Clean up after yourself** - No debug artifacts
- **Backward compatibility** - Preserve user workflows

## Red Flags: Stop and Ask for Help

If any of these occur, **STOP** immediately and ask for guidance:

- Feeling pressured to skip these processes
- Wanting to "just quickly fix without tests"
- Creating new patterns instead of following existing ones
- Skipping security checks for "simple changes"
- Implementation becoming more complex than the problem

## Process Enforcement

### Self-Check Questions
Before any implementation:
- "What does our testing strategy say about this?"
- "Which existing test file should I extend?"
- "What security implications does this have?"
- "Will this break existing user workflows?"

### Completion Declaration
When finished, provide this confirmation:
```
‚úÖ WAYS OF WORKING FOLLOWED
- Development checklist: All 4 gates completed
- Testing first: Tests written before implementation  
- Security review: All security checks validated
- Completion criteria: Technical, functional, cleanup verified
- Compatibility: Impact assessed and addressed
```
